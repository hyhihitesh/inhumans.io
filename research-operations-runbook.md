## Scheduler Wiring
- Vercel cron is configured in `apps/web/vercel.json`:
  - Path: `/api/follow-ups/schedule/daily`
  - Schedule: `0 13 * * *` (daily, 13:00 UTC)
  - Path: `/api/content/drafts/schedule/weekly`
  - Schedule: `0 14 * * 3` (Wednesday, 14:00 UTC)
  - Path: `/api/research/schedule/weekly`
  - Schedule: `0 13 * * 1` (every Monday, 13:00 UTC)
  - Path: `/api/reporting/schedule/weekly`
  - Schedule: `0 15 * * 1` (every Monday, 15:00 UTC)

## Monitoring Signals
- Dashboard section: `Research Orchestrator`
  - Watch `Scheduled failures` and `Last scheduled run`.
  - Use `Retry as manual` on failed scheduled runs.
- Telemetry logs (JSON)
  - `research_run_request`
  - `research_run_finished`
  - `provider_run_start`
  - `provider_run_success`
  - `provider_run_error`
  - `scheduler_weekly_start`
  - `scheduler_weekly_finished`
  - `followup_scheduler_auth_failed`
  - `content_scheduler_auth_failed`
  - `reporting_scheduler_auth_failed`
  - `reporting_delivery_success`
  - `reporting_delivery_failure`
  - `reporting_delivery_exhausted`
  - Mailbox observability via `message_events` and `message_event_failures` tables.
  - Pipeline audit: `pipeline_stage_events`.
  - Calendar linkage health: `calendar_events`.

## Incident Playbook
1. Check scheduler health endpoints for failed runs:
   - `GET /api/follow-ups/schedule/daily?token=...`
   - `GET /api/content/drafts/schedule/weekly?token=...`
   - `GET /api/research/schedule/weekly?token=...`
   - `GET /api/reporting/schedule/weekly?token=...`
2. For research failures, open dashboard and review scheduled failure table.
3. Retry affected research runs from UI (`Retry as manual`).
4. If research provider failures persist:
   - Increase `RESEARCH_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` moderately.
   - Reduce batch pressure using `SCHEDULED_FIRM_BATCH_LIMIT` or `SCHEDULED_PROSPECT_LIMIT_PER_FIRM`.
5. For follow-up/content failures:
   - Verify scheduler token and cron wiring.
   - Validate `scheduler_runs` records for `status = failed`.
   - Re-run `POST` endpoint manually with token after fixing cause.
6. For reporting failures:
   - Inspect `reporting_runs` and `reporting_deliveries` for status/error details.
   - Re-run reporting scheduler manually after fixing delivery or data issues.
7. For mailbox webhook failures:
   - Check `message_event_failures` for malformed payload patterns.
   - Validate signature secret and provider webhook signing config.
   - Verify idempotency behavior in `message_events` (`provider + external_event_id` unique).
8. For calendar sync failures:
   - Check OAuth provider connection status in settings.
   - Inspect calendar API error codes (`oauth_reauth_required`, `calendar_provider_unavailable`).
   - Validate persisted link rows in `calendar_events` and stage logs in `pipeline_stage_events`.
9. Validate recovery by confirming:
   - New successful scheduled/manual runs.
   - Failed count drops in scheduler health response.

## Reporting Delivery Incident Triage
Use this flow for top reporting incidents without opening DB console first:

1. Open dashboard/analytics reporting observability card.
2. Capture:
   - `Last run at`
   - `Failed (last run)`
   - `Top error codes (last run)`
   - `Retries exhausted`
3. Follow incident-specific path below.

### Incident A: Recipient misconfiguration (`recipient_unconfigured`)
1. Confirm `REPORTING_DIGEST_RECIPIENTS` is set with comma-separated valid emails.
2. Verify no trailing invalid separators and no blank values.
3. Trigger `POST /api/reporting/schedule/weekly` with scheduler token.
4. Confirm failed count returns to `0` and latest run moves to completed.

### Incident B: Resend credential/API failure (`delivery_config_missing`, `resend_http_401`, `resend_http_403`)
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is present and rotated secret is active.
2. Verify `REPORTING_FROM_EMAIL` uses a verified Resend sender/domain.
3. If credential rotation happened, redeploy to refresh runtime env.
4. Trigger manual scheduler run and verify deliveries transition from `failed` to `sent`.

### Incident C: Retry exhaustion (`resend_http_429`, `resend_http_5xx`, `resend_network_error`)
1. Confirm `Retries exhausted` count and top code from observability block.
2. If `429`, reduce scheduler batch pressure temporarily (`REPORTING_SCHEDULER_BATCH_LIMIT`).
3. If `5xx`/network, wait for provider recovery window and rerun manually.
4. Validate new run completes with decreased failed delivery count.

## Emergency Rollback (Reporting Delivery Mode)
Use when delivery provider is degraded and digest generation must continue:

1. Set `REPORTING_DELIVERY_MODE=log`.
2. Deploy/restart service so env changes are active.
3. Trigger manual reporting scheduler run to validate log-path completion.
4. Keep mode in `log` until provider incident is resolved.
5. Restore `REPORTING_DELIVERY_MODE=resend` and verify with one manual run before resuming cron-only operations.

## Guardrails
- Concurrency lock: only one active research run per firm.
- Retry cap: max 3 retries for run-based retries.
- Provider calls are timeout-bounded and fail fast.
- Idempotency markers: `scheduler_runs(job_name, firm_id, window_key)` unique constraint prevents duplicate daily/weekly firm runs.
